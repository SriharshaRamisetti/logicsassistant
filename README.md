i have created this project for my personal use purpose keeping my laptop dimensions in to considerations it may not work for every other laptop which have other dimensions i am sure i will improvise this to every laptop and make it work for every other laptop which have variable dimensions 
Here you can see that importing.py file is the main code snippet that handles all the required tasks and remaining files are the sample one where i have tested its executions
